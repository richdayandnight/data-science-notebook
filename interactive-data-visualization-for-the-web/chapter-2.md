# Interactive Data Visualization for the Web
# Chapter 2: Introducing D3
My personal notes from the book :)

## What is D3
    - Data-Driven Documents
      - data is provided by you
      - documents are web-based documents
    - name is a clever allusion of W3 (world wide web)

## What it does
- Loading data into the browser's memory
- Binding data to elements within the document, creating new elements as needed
- Transforming those elements by interpreting each element's bound datum and setting its visual properties accordingly.
- Transitioning elements between states in response to user input.

## Interesting Tools
- Paper.js
