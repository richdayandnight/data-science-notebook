# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

## Introduction

This book covers the fundamentals of data engineering, from it's definition and life cycle to it's core architecural concepts and security. The author discusses the fundamenals in general terms such that it would be applicable to any technology you would like to utilize for your project.

What did the preface tell me?

- The heart of the book is the data engineering life cycle; the other chapters support it. Connect the dots of the end-to-end data life cycle; how to stitch together various technologies to serve the needs of downstream data consumers (data scientists, analysts, machine learning engineers) best practices is taught to at every stage of the data life cycle
- The reason why specific technologies, tools, and platforms are not explained in depth in the book is because the authors didn't want to write a book with short shelf life.
- Cloud first approach. The authors view cloud as a 'fundamentally transformative development' that will endure for decades

- The authors jokingle refer to themselves as recovering data scientists because of their struggles to execute data science products because of their lack of data engineering foundation. A big chunk of data science involves data and yet, very often, are data science talents not trained to address a lot of data tasks like data collection, data cleansing, data access, data transformation, and data infrastructure. I do agree with this as often times in school, because of the short time provided for a certain term (time constraints), most of the times the data provided in an assignment/ project are often already cleaned or at least organized in a way that these steps are skipped.

## Preface Thoughts

Data engineering is an essential process in implementing a data science solution. Yet, oftentimes it would be an afterthought when we take our data science classes due to the lack of time. This was the case when I was in the university. It's kind of relatable to know that the authors referred to themselves as *recovering data scientists* because of their struggles to execute data science products because of their lack of data engineering foundation. Now, hopefully, instructors and professors take more time to purposely teach how to do data engineering tasks so that no more student would face the same struggles.

As mentioned in my book introduction, the authors wrote the fundamentals in general terms so that the book would have a longer shelf life than technology-focused books. With this said, the author still do talk about certain technologies, all of which are cloud-first approach, but not just in depth. They introduce these technologies because they view cloud as a 'fundamentally transformative development' that will endure for decades. Stepping back from the specific tools and technologies, the authors emphasized that the heart of the book is the data engineering life cycle as the other chapters support it. Through this overview, the author wishes the reader to learn how to connect the dots of end-to-end data life cycle, stitch together various technologies to serve the needs of downstream data consumers, and implement the best practices at every stage of teh data life cycle.
