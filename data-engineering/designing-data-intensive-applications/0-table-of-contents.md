The book "Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalabale, and Maintainable Systems" by Martin Kleppman with the software engineers and architects in mind so that they will learn how to make sense of data buzzwords, how to apply ideas in practice, and how to make full use of data in modern applications. This book makes, us, readers try to find useful ways of thinking about data systems—not just how they work, but also why they work that way, and what questions we need to ask.

Technology is a powerful force in our society. Data, software, and communication can
be used for bad: to entrench unfair power structures, to undermine human rights, and
to protect vested interests. But they can also be used for good: to make underrepresented
people’s voices heard, to create opportunities for everyone, and to avert disasters. This
book is dedicated to everyone working toward the good.

## Table of Contents

**Part 1** tallks about abstract ideas/ foundation / must know terms in data systems. The 3 most important adjective that a data system must be (reliable, scalable, and maintainable) is expounded on this section. Data model types, structure, and formatting are also discussed. The indexing on chapter 3 piques my interest.

**Part 2** explains more about distributed data. Despite me encountering some of the terms mentioned here, a lot are still unfamiliar to me. This would be a good reference.

**Part 3** asserts that in reality data systems are complex which is why in large applications, a combination of serveral different datasores, indexes, etc. are used. Issues on integrating multiple data systems are discussed here.


## Preface

Difference between data-intensive and compute-intensive
- data-intensive
  - data is its primary challenge (qty of data, complexity of data, speed that it's changing)
- compute-intensive
  - CPU cycles are the bottleneck
